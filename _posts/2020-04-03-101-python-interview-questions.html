title: 101 Python Interview Questions
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The problem this post will try to solve: <br>
  <strong> For a developer working with Python 3 in the United States with less than 5 years of experience, what are the most common interview questions?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What are the current resouces available? <br>
  An in depth Google search returns a lot of questions about Python, but not how common they are. Some are put up by companies, but they don't expose their data so you just have to trust them. I prefer to see the data.
</p>
<p>
  What resources are provided? <br>
  <ul>
    <li> 101 questions with answers, examples and linked documentation so the answers are verifiably correct. The rank of the question is listed, but the questions are randomly sorted and periodically resorted since most people are not likely to work through all of them. </li>
    <li> 101 Notecards with the questions, answers, and examples </li>
    <li> The collected data in a view only google sheet </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  What I ask of you? <br>
  If you use these resources, then contribute. If you find them useful in doing well on an interview or for another purpose, them message me. I would love to hear from you. If I have enough data, I am happy to expand the scope / make more lists, i.e. run one for beginner and advanced or run one for django.
</p>
<p>
  Useful resorces: <br>
  There are a lot of lists out there. My list is pretty comprehensive, but seeks brevity for each answer so that you can give the interviewer a snappy answer. Chris I. on the other hand gives <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/53-python-interview-questions-and-answers-91fa311eec3f">very thorough answers.</a>

  Sections:
  <ol start=1>
    <li> Knowledge questions: Do you know this information? </li>
    <li> Standard coding questions: Questions with specific best answers that if you have not seen once, are hard to figure out on the spot but trivial once you have seen it. </li>
    <li> Coding exercises: Exercises that check knowledge of a specific concept. I will provide a samples and updated them based on current feedback. </li>
  </ol>
