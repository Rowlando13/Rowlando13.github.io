title: template 101 Python Interview Questions
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The problem this post will try to solve: <br>
  <strong> For a developer working with Python 3 in the United States with less than 5 years of experience, what are the most common interview questions?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What are the current resouces available? <br>
  An in depth Google search returns a lot of questions about Python, but not how common they are. Some are put up by companies, but they don't expose their data so you just have to trust them. I prefer to see the data.
</p>
<p>
  What resources are provided? <br>
  <ul>
    <li> 60 questions with answers, examples and linked documentation so the answers are verifiably correct. 101 is my expected amount. I put together 60, and as feedback comes I will add. The rank of the question is listed, but the questions are randomly sorted and periodically resorted since the questions at the top are most likely to get feedback. </li>
    <li> Upon request, all questions and answers as notecards on quizlet. If I get 5 requests, then I can write a selenium program that makes a notecard deck through quizlet, etc. Basically, I ran out of steam to do this, but will do it with a knudge that it will be useful for people. </li>
    <li> The collected data in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zRdS_H9Zs6YFKacxhYwGcOLt8boe54pu3U0jxfnaAKw/edit?usp=sharing"> view only google sheet. </a> </li>
    <li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zRdS_H9Zs6YFKacxhYwGcOLt8boe54pu3U0jxfnaAKw/edit?usp=sharing">The key</a> that maps the number on the data sheet to questions. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  What I ask of you? <br>
  If you use these resources, then contribute. If you find them useful in doing well on an interview or for another purpose, them message me. I would love to hear from you. If I have enough data, I am happy to expand the scope / make more lists, i.e. run one for beginner and advanced or run one for django.
</p>
<p>
  Useful resorces: <br>
  There are a lot of lists out there. My list is pretty comprehensive, but seeks brevity for each answer so that you can give the interviewer a snappy answer. Chris I. on the other hand gives <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/53-python-interview-questions-and-answers-91fa311eec3f">very thorough answers.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Sections:
  <ol start=1>
    <li> Knowledge questions: Do you know this information? </li>
    <li> Standard coding questions: Questions with specific best answers that if you have not seen once, are hard to figure out on the spot but trivial once you have seen it. </li>
    <li> Coding exercises: Exercises that check knowledge of a specific concept. I will provide a samples and updated them based on current feedback. </li>
  </ol>

  (Medium only)This article is best read on <a href="https://www.girling.info/2020/04/03/101-python-interview-questions/" >my website (no advertising), </a> because Medium does not allow inline code so you have to scroll up to the top to submit feedback after each question. On <a href="https://www.girling.info/2020/04/03/101-python-interview-questions/" >my website (no advertising), </a> the feedback is part of the article after each question.
