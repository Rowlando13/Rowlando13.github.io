## Site

This website is my place for my work that does not already have a place. Sometimes Medium is best (high page rank); sometimes Github is best (version control); other times I need a place where I control everything (here).

## Me
#### Curious
I have not met many people who are more curious me. Some people are strong. Some people are good looking. I wonder about stuff, mostly mathematics, science, software, religion, and rock climbing, but really anything.

#### Long Thinker
I like hard problems. The harder and larger the better. In college, I thought about religion a lot and mathematics as it applied to machine learning and quantum computing. In the Navy, I thought about what I was going to do when I was not in the Navy, but that is what pretty much everyone in the Navy does. Now, human performance, natural language processing, religion a good bit, and job interviews.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rowlando_13).

## Site Framework
In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, [Poole](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) themes.

Thanks for reading!
